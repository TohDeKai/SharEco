# SharEco

## What is it about?

SharEco is an innovative sustainability initiative that aims to curb consumerism and waste by encouraging and incentivising the sharing of under-utilised items. The primary goal of SharEco is to create a culture of sharing, where individuals can lend and borrow items they use occasionally, thereby reducing the need for excessive consumption and lowering waste production.

Our strategy for this initiative includes both Consumer-to-Consumer Lending and Business-to-Consumer Lending. Additionally, to establish a sustainable model, we intend to integrate transactional benefits that incentivise both users and businesses to engage with our platform.

All in all, we aim to address sustainability challenges with an innovative approach that leverages on a user-friendly mobile platform that connects lenders and borrowers â€“ SharEco.
